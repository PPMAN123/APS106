    "| % | modulo (remainder) | 9 % 2 | 9 mod 2 | 1 |\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "The first 3 (addition, subtraction, multiplication) should be easy - with the slight issue that multiplication is represented by `*`. This is pretty common in (almost) all programming languages.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Division\n",
    "\n",
    "Division comes in two flavours.\n",
    "\n",
    "First, the `/` operator divides a number by another number (integer or decimal) and returns and represents the result **as a `float`** (a value type with decimal places - we'll discuss later this lecture).\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "10/3 = 3.333333333333333\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "The second division operator is integer division. It divides the first number by the second with the result being **truncated** to an integer value. \"Truncated\" means that everything after the decimal is thrown away.  NOTE THAT WE SAID TRUNCATED, NOT ROUNDED.\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "10/3 = 3.0\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "If the two operands of `//` (the two numbers being divided) are both `int`, then the result will be an `int`. If either of the two operands is a `float`, then the result will be a `float` (even though it will have a whole number value).\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Exponentiation\n",
    "\n",
    "Python has a nice exponentiation operator `**`\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Modulo\n",
    "\n",
    "The last operator may be new to you. It is the modulo operator repesented by `%`. It is also a kind of division but it results in the **remainder** after dividing the operands. "
